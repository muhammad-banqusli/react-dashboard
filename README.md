This web app is a versatile dashboard built using React and Material-UI components, designed to provide an intuitive user interface for data visualization and management. The dashboard comes equipped with dynamic theming, offering both a sleek dark mode for reduced eye strain in low-light environments and full RTL (Right-to-Left) support for improved accessibility and user experience in languages that read from right to left.

Features:

- Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless experience across various screen sizes and devices.
- Dark Mode: Enhances user comfort during extended usage in low-light conditions.
- RTL Support: Accommodates users in languages that follow a right-to-left reading direction.
This project was inspired and originally built by Ed Roh. Explore the live demo  [here](https://react-dashboard-peach.vercel.app/) and experience the convenience of a modern dashboard with enhanced visual and functional capabilities.

Feel free to customize and integrate this dashboard into your projects for efficient data management and a visually appealing user interface.
